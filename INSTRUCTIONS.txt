Introduction:

In the world of Tic-Tac-Toe, competition can be brutal. If you consider yourself a champion of the game, try playing 
against me.  I will only lose to you once by any combination of inputs in the game (unless you cheat and say ... delete
a particularly important file).


Playing the game:

Let me be 'X' and you be 'O'. I go first. Always. Sorry, I am the one at the disadvantage. 

If this is a new game, I always ask "Shall we play a game?" You must enter Y to play, or either N or Q to chicken out. I
will move and then show you the board with my move and prompt you to enter the number for the square you wish to mark.
Once a game has begun, you must finish it to be allowed to quit.

After I move, I will prompt you for your move. You must then indicate your move by entering the number of any unmarked 
square. If you move, I will redisplay the board with your move and my next move. This playful step repeats
until a) I win, or b) it's a tie, c) you quit, or d) (God forbid) you win.


Winning the game:

You will only win once by a given pattern of moves. I learn quickly. If you like to always win, prepare to be
disappointed.
